Here the i created a basic Gogo Anime website Clone (this website provides all anime shows to watch freely ).

I took the reference or as a model of this website and developed as similar as features and backgrounds by using a basic HTML, CSS and JS. i used responsiveness in website ,scaling, transform, animation, keyframes, hyperlinks, and so on. 

Here the blocks you can see..those are the episodes for that anime. Each episode block represents each anime episode. By clicking or hover on the those one particular block , the block will it will changes the color to the yellow.(i created this effect using a simple hover attribute in CSS).
By clinking a any one episode block, the screen will be redirect to the episode download page. where you can download the episode at your prefer quality.
 The BACK TO TOP with symbol of arrow is created to make action when were you wanted to go back to top , you can click on it and BOOM will you go to the TOP. This function is created by the Java Script( JS ).
